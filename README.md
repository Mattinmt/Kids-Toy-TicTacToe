# Kids-Toy-TicTacToe
Final Project for ECE387
Project By: Michael Mattingly

For my project i decided to create a Tic Tac Toe Board for kids of all Ages.

Attached in the file are two different documents. The first being the Arduino code to upload onto your Arduino Uno and the second being a ".h" library called Charlieplexing. 

In order to reduce the number of pins needed for the project, I created a button matrix using resistors. Second, I decided to Charlieplex all of the LEDs together. With Charlieplexing, your are able to wire together a total of 20 LED's on only 5 digital pins.

Parts included in Tic Tac Toe Board:
  - Arduino Uno
  - 10 Green LEDs
  - 10 Red LEDs
  - 10 Push Buttons
  - 3 1kΩ Resistors
  - 2 4.7kΩ Resistors
  - 1 10kΩ Resistor

Within the Arduino Code are 3 different circumstances.
The game could either end in a tie, with the User winning, or with the Computer winning.
Attached below are videos showcasing all three of theese outcomes.
